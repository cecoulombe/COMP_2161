        <item>Calgary, a cosmopolitan Alberta city with numerous skyscrapers, owes its rapid growth to its status as the centre of Canada’s oil industry. However, it’s still steeped in the western culture that earned it the nickname “Cowtown,” evident in the Calgary Stampede, its massive July rodeo and festival that grew out of the farming exhibitions once presented here. - Google, 2024</item>
        <item>Victoria, capital of British Columbia, sits on the craggy southern end of Vancouver Island. With abundant parkland, it’s known for outdoor activities.

        <item>Vancouver, a bustling west coast seaport in British Columbia, is among Canada’s densest, most ethnically diverse cities.

        <item>Toronto, the capital of the province of Ontario, is a major Canadian city along Lake Ontario’s northwestern shore. It\'s a dynamic metropolis with a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic, free-standing CN Tower.

        <item>Kamloops is a Canadian city in British Columbia, where the North and South Thompson rivers meet. Sun Peaks Resort’s hiking trails, bike park and numerous ski runs lie to the northeast. Cougars and bears inhabit the British Columbia Wildlife Park east of town. West, above Kamloops Lake are clay hoodoos (or spires). The riverside Secwepemc Museum and Heritage Park features the remains of a 2,000-year-old village. - Google, 2024</item>
